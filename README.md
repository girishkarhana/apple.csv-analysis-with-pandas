**Project Overview**

We’re going to do a super thorough analysis of Apple phone data to answer some important questions and uncover some really interesting trends. We’ll look at the ratings, reviews, prices, and discounts for Apple phones, and we’ll also figure out how they’re all connected.

**Features of the Analysis**

Here are some of the cool things we’ll be doing:

1. * **Top 5 Apple Phones with the Most 5-Star Ratings:** We’ll find out which Apple phones have the most 5-star ratings.
2. * **Bottom 5 Apple Phones with the Least 5-Star Ratings:** We’ll also find out which Apple phones have the least 5-star ratings.
3. * **Ratings Analysis for the Top 5 Apple Phones:** We’ll dig into the ratings given to the top 5 Apple phones.
4. * **Ratings Analysis for the Bottom 5 Apple Phones:** We’ll also look at the ratings given to the bottom 5 Apple phones.
5. * **Most Reviewed Apple Phones:** We’ll figure out which Apple phones have the most reviews.
6. * **Least Reviewed Apple Phones:** We’ll also find out which Apple phones have the least reviews.
7. * **Price vs. Ratings:** We’ll see if there’s a connection between how much a phone costs and how many people like it.This study looked into how the price of Apple phones changes when they get more reviews.
